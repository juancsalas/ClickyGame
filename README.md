This is a memory game where the user tries to not repeat selected panels for as long as possible. Each time a panel is selected, the app will shuffle the panels adding a level of difficulty. 

The app uses Create React App and several components to create the complete application.

It is also themed after the Television show The Simpsons and included several design elements from the program.
